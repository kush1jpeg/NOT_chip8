Do CHIP-8, but don’t stop at “it runs Pong.” Push it:

Add disassembler/debugger.

Add step-through execution.

Implement super-CHIP-8 extension (higher res, extra ops).

Write your own CHIP-8 assembler, so you can code games for it.

Then when you go Game Boy, you’re not just another dude who “read Pan Docs and copied someone’s C code.”
You’ll have the emulator mental model burned into your cortex.
